Base Apparel Challenge for Frontend Mentor

Hi there! Thanks for viewing my solution.

Please let me know how I may resolve the following issues.

1 - I'm using grids for my css, and in the tablet view, I can't seem to align the picture to stretch the full length of the viewport.

2 - I can't seem to figure out the validation part of the form. It works when I use an invalid email, but somehow it doesn't allow submission for a valid email.

3 - I can't seem to figure out how to retrieve a pesudo element in JavaScript. I'm using a pseudo element for the error icon.

4 - Please advise me on some workarounds, as well as ways to improve my overall code.

Thanks again! :)
